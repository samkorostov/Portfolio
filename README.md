# My Serverless Portfolio Website

This repository will contain the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website will be built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** (with AWS Lambda) for the back-end, creating a serverless architecture. The site will showcase my projects, skills, and contact information, and will be fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## NOTE: Currently only functioning on LocalHost, finalizing visual appearance then working on backend

## Roadmap

### 1: Set up Frontend:
- [X] Create barebones "proof of concept" react project with components (Header, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- [X] Implement styling using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- [X] Implement visually appealing styling
- [X] Implement direct link to project README.mds
- [X] Add a place to download resume
- [ ] Ensure hyperlinks in those READMEs are valid
### 2: Backend Setup (Serverless)
- [ ] Set up AWS Lambda functions for backend logic (e.g., contact form)
- [ ] Configure API Gateway to trigger Lambda
- [ ] Integrate AWS SES for email sending
- [ ] Connect front-end with API
### 3: Deployment (TBD depending on what I decide to use)
