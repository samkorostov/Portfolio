# My Serverless Portfolio Website

This repository will contain the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website will be built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** (with AWS Lambda) for the back-end, creating a serverless architecture. The site will showcase my projects, skills, and contact information, and will be fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## Roadmap

### 1: Set up Frontend:
- [ ] Create barebones "proof of concept" react project with components (Header, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- [ ] Implement styling using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- [ ] Implement Light/Dark mode and any other visually appealing styling
### 2: Backend Setup (Serverless)
- [ ] Set up AWS Lambda functions for backend logic (e.g., contact form)
- [ ] Configure API Gateway to trigger Lambda
- [ ] Integrate AWS SES for email sending
- [ ] Connect front-end with API
### 3: Deployment (TBD depending on what I decide to use)
