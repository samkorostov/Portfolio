# My Serverless Portfolio Website

This repository will contain the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website will be built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** (with AWS Lambda) for the back-end, creating a serverless architecture. The site will showcase my projects, skills, and contact information, and will be fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## This project is hosted through GitHub pages

## Roadmap

### 1: Set up Frontend:
- [X] Create barebones "proof of concept" react project with components (Header, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- [X] Implement styling using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- [X] Implement visually appealing styling
- [X] Implement direct link to project README.mds
- [X] Add a place to download resume

- [ ] Make everything "Look cool"
