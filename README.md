# My Serverless Portfolio Website

This repository will contain the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website will be built using **React**, as well as **Tailwind CSS**. The site will showcase my projects, skills, and contact information, and will be fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## NOTE: Currently only functioning on LocalHost, finalizing visual appearance and resume download functionality before re-deploying to Github Pages

## Roadmap

### 1: Set up Frontend:
- [X] Create barebones "proof of concept" react project with components (Header, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- [X] Implement styling using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- [X] Implement visually appealing styling
- [X] Implement direct link to project README.mds
- [X] Add a place to download resume
- [X] Ensure hyperlinks in those READMEs are valid
- [ ] Make everything "Look cool"
### 2: Implement some sort of cloud hosting (TBD):

## Dependencies:
- **React**: Used for building UI
- **Node.js**: Used for development and package management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling
- **Marked**: Used to render markdown in README files for linked projects
