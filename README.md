# My Serverless Portfolio Website

This repository will contain the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website will be built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** (with AWS Lambda) for the back-end, creating a serverless architecture. The site will showcase my projects, skills, and contact information, and will be fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Front-End Development
- [ ] Initialize React project
- [ ] Implement components (Header, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- [ ] Add responsive styling with Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- [ ] Implement dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] Set up React Router (optional)

### Phase 2: Backend Setup (Serverless)
- [ ] Set up AWS Lambda functions for backend logic (e.g., contact form)
- [ ] Configure API Gateway to trigger Lambda
- [ ] Integrate AWS SES for email sending
- [ ] Connect front-end with API using Fetch or Axios

### Phase 3: Deployment
- [ ] Deploy front-end on Vercel or Netlify
- [ ] Set up AWS S3/CloudFront for static hosting (alternative)
- [ ] Secure website with HTTPS
- [ ] Connect custom domain and set up CI/CD
